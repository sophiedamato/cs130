For decades now, clothing, plastic, and food manufacturers have scoured intensive, complex research to “find” new, sustainable practices, while for thousands of years before the industrialization of the west, American Indians have practiced genuine symbiotic relationships with the envirnometn around them. 


Offering rehabilitation and restoration to the ecosystem they depend on, the Bad River Ojibwe Tribe have been subsistence farmers for centuries. 


Fish 
Restauration to the population
Filet process // takes wayyy longer than 
They reproduce the population simply because they want to keep fishing and because theyre good people and want other people to fish too 

Manoomin 
Traditional practices
Wayyyy more difficult to mass produce // you only are able to make enough for a few dinners at a time 


Find another? // maple syrup 

Lack of the importance placed on material items // more so about connection and family 
Once the crops are gathered, none is wasted, it goes out into the wild
The expectation of sharing 
Doesnt matter if you like the elders, you MUST share your food with them 



Conclusion: 
Talk about the decision to not develop on Madeline island or the coastline…. Preventing tourism and no economic benefit, but has kept the beaches beautiful 
They don’t have “organic” labeling… why pay thousands of dollars for a tag that “ensures” ethics? when you produce your own food, you already know where it comes from 
What is our goal here? 
Look at food waste statistics
The problem isn't feeding those who can afford food, its using our resources in a conscious way and helping those in need with the extra we have 

Sustainability doesnt have to look like patagonia baggie shorts and chacos– it can be living everyday life in a more conscious way
